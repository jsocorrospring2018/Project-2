# Project-2
Project 2 was one of the best and fun ways to test myself of what I learned throughout
the entire class. If anything I spent 6-8 hours when I was making the first deliverable
and overall it does what I need it to do for the task at hand. I was able to write,
create, and style the website that I have envisioned. My progress in class was exponential
because in the beginning I had a bad understanding on CSS styling. But with enough
coding I was able to get comfortable with how I need to make a site approachable. What
I really enjoyed was the fact that I did this project myself because I was irresponsible
on contacting my other teammates. I could only imagine what will it be like if I had
two other members. My site still has some problems but I was able to envision my perspective
on the what the ISUD should be like, simple and clean and straight to the point.
